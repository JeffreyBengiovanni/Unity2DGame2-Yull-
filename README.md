# Unity2DGame2-Yull-
Second game made in Unity. I took a break to mess around with 3D, but realized making assets in 2D was much more time efficient for me. This project uses AstarPathfindingProject, and since it is not my scripts, I did not include them in this repository. I followed a tutorial for the basic inventory and basic dungeon generation, but have heavily modified and upgraded what they do in my code (Thanks to SunnyValleyStudio for the tutorials).
